Hm. This is just a wall painted to look like a door!
But there's a note here:
  
  Across the seven continents and six seas, there lie five great mountains,
  each with at least three peaks. In one of them, there you'll find buried
  treasure, pirate's booty and pieces of eight.

I wonder what that could mean.
